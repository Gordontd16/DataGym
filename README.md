# DataGym Exercise 

Exercise Brief:

DataGymâ„¢ is a commercial gym chain with points of presence in multiple UK cities.

Following a recent change in management, they've asked your team to investigate the performance of their gyms, and suggest areas for improvement. They've provided you with the following datasets:
1. Their customer database, which includes basic demographics, as well as information collected from quitters (see below)
2. Their access log, including all visits each member made to their gyms

In addition, quitters were asked to complete a questionnaire covering the following five aspects when cancelling their subscription:
- Overall service
- Maintenance and equipment
- Cleanliness
- Location
- Cannot find time to exercise

Your task is to create a well-organised Jupyter Notebook (with code and output) containing:
1. A short description of the problem, including specific aims and hypotheses
2. A detailed description and exploration of the data available, including both tabular and graphical summaries
